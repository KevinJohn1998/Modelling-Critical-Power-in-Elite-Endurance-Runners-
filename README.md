# Modelling Critical-Power in Elite Endurance Runners 

# INTRO 
The hyperbolic relationship between power output (PO) and the duration for which it can be sustained was first described by Hill (1925). Monod and Scherrer (1965) further described this phenomenon using a 2-parameter model wherein critical power (CP) represents the asymptote and W’ represents the curvature of the power-time. Here, W’ signifies the finite amount of work that can be done above CP, whereas CP represents the highest work rate at which steady state values can be achieved for muscle metabolism and pulmonary oxygen uptake (Jones et al., 2008). Making it an important physiological threshold separating the high and severe intensity domains of exercise  (Jones et al., 2008, Pooles et al., 1988). Furthermore, this relationship  holds true for various modes of human locomotion such as cycling (Vanhatalo et al., 2008) , running (Smith & Jones, 2001), swimming (Wakayoshi et al., 1992)  and isometric contractions (Burnley et al., 2012) . Making it an important  concept applicable to various sports specifically in the field of fitness testing, program design and performance prediction.
